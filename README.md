### Description: 

* Create a donation submission page for a Walk-A-Thon.

* Donors should be able to enter their name, email and dollar amount & whether their donation is lump sum or per lap.

*Store the donor information as JS objects, in a private array in an IIFE.

*Use Bootstrap to style the form and table elements. .

*At desktop size display the table on the left and form on the right with some space around the sides.

*The page should have the same display on a tablet in landscape mode, but with no space at the sides.
 
*On mobile/vertical tablet the table should display above the form the table entries should be alternately striped

### Final Result:
> Enter donor information, click enter, and the info appears in a table on the right hand side while clearing all the fields.  Cancel button will clear any information already entered.

### Take-home Lesson:

> Bootstrap started clicking for me during this assigment.  Building the table with Bootstrap classes was really easy, and I liked using the framework to quickly add style to the forms and buttons in this project.
